In a grid environment, the possession of a certificate does not normally equate to gaining access to a protected resource. The division between authentication and authorisation is unusual from a user's point of view as it differs from the familiar model of gaining access to a system by obtaining a password for it. While in the long run mechanisms such as certificates or single sign-on systems provide benefits, they often require an initial effort that is not immediately rewarded by gaining access to a resource.
