  <para id="delete_me">Potential users of e-Infrastructures often lack the time and resources to explore their possible uses. One respondent commented:

"I can see that there are things there which we probably could be able to use in the future but first weâ€™d have to work out how [...] if we had the time to actually be able to get far enough into the technology to be able to actually utilise it properly." (researcher)

<item>Exemplars and use cases, developed not as demonstrations of technical feasibility but as ways to explore possible uses and socio-technical configurations can help to further uptake by communicating a vision or triggering competitiveness: 
<quote id="eip-id3202960">having stuff where you can show that people have done really new science using those tools [...] it seems to be working quite well in terms of getting engagement and we're seeing that other communities just like these things - like the systems biology communities are beginning to be very keen to play and join in." (researcher)</quote></item>
<item>Clearly, it is important for the community to formulate clearly where e-Infrastructure usage has made a significant difference to researchers and to disseminate these success stories widely to inspire more researchers to start engaging</item>
<item>It is important that the early exploration of technological options is supported and conducted as a conversation between researchers, service providers and intermediaries</item>
